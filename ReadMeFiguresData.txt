Statistical Post-processing Using Stratospheric Observations"

Files and their contents:
Korhonen_et_al_Figure1Data.nc
Data of Fig. 1: annual mean CRPSS and its p-value for forecast weeks 1-6 for the raw (RAW) 
and the mean bias-corrected (BC) surface mean temperature forecast.

Korhonen_et_al_Figure2Data_columns.txt
Data of Fig. 2: observed minimum daily AO indes 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after different stratospheric situations.

Korhonen_et_al_Figure4a_fData.nc
Data of Fig. 4a-f:
ERA-Interim observed mean t2m anomalies during November-February in 1981-2016, 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after SWIneg or SWIplain.
p-value that the means of these surface temperature anomalies differ 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after SWIneg or SWIplain.

Korhonen_et_al_Figure4g_lData.nc
Data of Fig. 4g-l:
ERA-Interim observed mean t2m anomalies during November-February in 1997-2016, 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after SWIneg or SWIplain.
p-value that the means of these surface temperature anomalies differ 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after SWIneg or SWIplain.

Korhonen_et_al_Figure4m_rData.nc
Data of Fig. 4m-r:
ECMWF reforecasted mean t2m anomalies for November-February in 1997-2016, 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after SWIneg or SWIplain.
p-value that the means of these reforecasted surface temperature anomalies differ 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 weeks after SWIneg or SWIplain.

Korhonen_et_al_Figure5Data.nc
Data of Fig. 5: The CRPSSs of the ECMWF surface temperature reforecasts in forecast weeks 3–4  and 5–6, 
when the kSWI was ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

Korhonen_et_al_Figure6Data.nc
Data of Fig. 6:
CRPSS of forecast weeks 3–4 and 5–6 of the ECMWF’s mean temperature reforecasts for November–February 1997–2016 
after mean bias-correction (BiasCorrected) and after both mean bias-correction and the SWI based post-processing (PostProcessed).
p-value that the CRPSS is above zero.
